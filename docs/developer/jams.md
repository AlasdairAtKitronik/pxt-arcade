# Game Jam Documentation

## Submitting a game on itch.io

On the game jam page, click 'Submit your project', then 'Upload game' in the dialog that pops up. From here, there are a few ways to link a MakeCode Arcade game.

### Save file

In the MakeCode Aracade editor with your game, click the Save icon on the bottom toolbar (next to the name of your project). This will download a PNG that also encodes your game! In itch.io, select 'Downloadable' as the kind of project and click the 'Upload files' button to upload your game PNG. Add title, cover image, and other details if you have them!

### Share URL

In the MakeCode Arcade editor, click 'Share' in the top left, then 'Publish Project'. Copy the generated URL and return to the itch.io 'Create a new project' page. Select 'Downloadable' as the kind of project, and paste the URL to your game in the description. Then fill in additional details about your game!

### HTML Embed

Embedding the game in itch.io is a little more complex, but will allow folks to play your game on the itch.io page directly! In the MakeCode Arcade editor, click 'Share' in the top left, then 'Publish Project'. At the bottom of the 'Share Project' dialog you will see a blue '> Embed' link. Click on that link and select the 'Simulator' tab. Copy the generated embed code into a text file, and save it as `[your game].html`

In the itch.io 'Create a new project' page, select 'HTML' as the kind of project. Click the 'Upload files' button to upload your HTML file, and check 'This file will be played in the browser'. Under 'Embed Options', we recommend:
* Width `500` px x Height `580` px
* Select the 'Mobile friendly', 'Automatically start', and 'Fullscreen button' checkboxes.

Fill in any additional details about your game, and hit publish!
